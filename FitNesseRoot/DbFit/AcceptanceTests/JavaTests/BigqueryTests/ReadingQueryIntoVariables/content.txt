!3 when whole query is read into variables, remember to use ? to prevent row matching as there is nothing to match the rows to - table should read out any results into parameters

!|query|select Date '2019-01-01' as dateparam |
|dateparam?|
|>>dateparam|

!|query|select Date '2019-01-01' as dateparam |
|dateparam|
|<<dateparam|
